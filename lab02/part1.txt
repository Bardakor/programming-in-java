1. Immutable Class with Private Fields and No Setters:
Not necessarily immutable; it depends on whether the class provides methods to modify its state.

2. Immutable Class with Private Primitive Fields and No Setters:
Likely immutable as long as there are no methods allowing state modification.

3. Why the Class is Not Immutable:
The class is not immutable because it exposes a public method that returns a reference to a mutable array.

4. Refactoring to One File-One Class:
Create a separate file named C.java for the class C with its definition in that file.

5. The class is not immutable because it exposes a public method getValues()
that provides direct access to its mutable array values.

6.
public class C {
    private int[] values;

    public int[] getValues() {
        return values;
    }
}
