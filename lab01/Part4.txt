1. Difference between == and equals:

== compares references (or values for primitives).
equals compares object content (can be customized).

2.Formula o1.equals(o2) $\implies$ hasCode(o1) == hashCode(o2):

Not always true in practice due to potential hashCode implementation issues.

3. Java Object Class:

Root class for all Java classes.
Provides basic methods like equals and hashCode.

4.General Contract of hashCode and equals:

Equals: Reflexive, Symmetric, Transitive, Consistent, Handles null.
HashCode: Consistency, Equals objects have equal hashCodes, Unequals objects may or may not have different hashCodes.
