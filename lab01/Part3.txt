1. Strategy for Defining Immutable Objects:

Make class final, fields private and final.
No mutator methods.
Initialize in constructor.
Ensure deep immutability.

2. Immutable Object vs. Immutable Class:

Immutable object cannot change; immutable class can have mutable fields.

3. Advantages of Immutable Objects:

Thread-safe.
Simplifies code.
Supports caching.
Predictable behavior.
Hashable.

4. Uses of Java Records:

Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).
Value Objects.
Records simplify data class creation and generate common methods.
